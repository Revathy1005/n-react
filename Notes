Js hello world and React hello world
REact Hello world we need to include CDN links in .html file we created.One link React.js and another ReactDOM.js

<script>
    const heading=React.createElement("h1",{},"Hello World")
React.createElement is an object not html.In the process of rendering it converted to html for understanding the browser.
const root= ReactDOM.createRoot(document.getElementByID("root));
root.render(heading);
If there is anything inside our root it is completely replaced not appended.
Why React is called a library?
It can be used in a small portion of a code in our page that is why it is called library
